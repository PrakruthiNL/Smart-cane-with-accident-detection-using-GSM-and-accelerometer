This project integrates accident detection and obstacle detection functionalities to enhance the safety of a blind person. The system uses an accelerometer to monitor motion and detect sudden impacts, which may indicate an accident. When an impact is detected, the system calculates the magnitude based on changes in the X, Y, and Z axes. If the magnitude exceeds a predefined sensitivity threshold, the system recognizes it as an accident and, after a delay, initiates a call to an emergency contact using a SIM800 GSM module and sends an SMS alert indicating the occurrence of the accident. This ensures that timely assistance is provided.

Simultaneously, the system incorporates an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. The sensor measures the distance to the nearest object by emitting an ultrasonic pulse and calculating the time it takes for the echo to return. If an obstacle is detected within a set distance threshold, the system activates a buzzer to alert the user, helping them avoid collisions. These combined features make the system a comprehensive safety solution for blind individuals, enabling them to navigate their environment while also ensuring that they receive help promptly in case of an accident.
